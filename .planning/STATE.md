## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Tauri 2.x + Node.js sidecar (not Electron) -- mediasoup, Express, WebSocket run in sidecar process
- [Roadmap]: Both Dante/AES67 AND local audio device capture supported from v1
- [Roadmap]: GStreamer child processes per channel for fault isolation
- [Roadmap]: Research recommended Electron but project chose Tauri for lower resource usage

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research Gap]: PTP clock synchronization on Windows has sparse documentation -- needs validation in Phase 2
- [Research Gap]: GStreamer Windows minimal bundling approach unclear -- impacts Phase 10
- [Research Flag]: Phase 3 audio processing (RNNoise latency) may need deeper research during planning
